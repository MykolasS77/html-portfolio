<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello. I am Mykolas, an aspiring web developer based in Vilnius, Lithuania. My current website may not look like much, but I am willing to
  improve and make it more beautiful than it is right now. Hopefully once I learn more about web development, my website will look much cooler. </p>

<p>My hobbies include music and video games. I play guitar, I like to record, mix and master my own songs. Talking about games,
   I am currently playing the new "Elden Ring" DLC called Shadow of the Erdtree. This game is notorious for being super difficult 
   and that's why many people don't even think about trying it. But the main point of this game is not giving up and fighting all of the 
   enemies over and over and over again and once you defeat it, you get an enormous sense of achievement. I try to keep this mentality with 
   everything I do! When I encounter life problems, I imagine it as being an "Elden Ring" boss which I have to fight over and over and over again.
    And no matter how difficult it loks at first, I am always able to deal with it in the end.</p>
